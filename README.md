# Udacity-Explore-Weather-Trends
This project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree course requirements. The goal was to retrieve the relevant data via SQL, and analyze it to find trends in the global temperature averages, and the temperature trends of a particular city. The city selected for this project was Bangalore, India. 

Steps followed in this project include:
1. Extract the relevant data from the database
2. Calculate moving averages for the global temperature data and the city temperature data
3. Plot line graphs for the extracted data
4. Highlight key observations comparing global temperature data to the selected city temperature data
